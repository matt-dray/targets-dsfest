# Reproducevangelism

???
* I don't want to condescend or dictate, I want to build from the general principle of 'reproducible is good'
* So let's define 'reproducibility'
* Very important in scientific fields given the reproducibility crisis

From [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) by The Alan Turing Institute

???
* We could get into a heated debate about the definition
* The book is a great free resource for reproduciblity in general
* I think we care about both (i) recreating outputs and (ii) updating with fresh data
* I'm going to refer to this top row as reproducibility throughout

[Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/)

???
* In government we recognise the benefits of reproducible analysis and publications
* Literally this is a badge of pride in government
* We want to make sure the whole end-to-end process from data to publication is repeatable
* We want to build trust, but also make it easier to update publications as new data emerges
* I wrote a thing about how {drake} might be useful for RAP in government
* There are similar tools in other languages

Can I recreate what you did:

* from scratch?
* on a different machine?
* in the future?
* without you present?

???
* Do I have all the code, files and documentation?
* Can I do it on another OS with dependencies missing?
* Will the code still work next year, or will dependency chenages break it?
* Did you document it well enough? Is everything stored somewhere remotely?

---

R has [many reproducibility tools](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research-dc.html#1), like:

* [RStudio Projects](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/) to keep everything together
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for reproducible docs
* [packages](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/) for reusable functions
* [{here}](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) for relative filepaths
* [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for dependency management

???
* Some general tools, but also packages for very specific things like filepath management
* Of course, there's agnostic tools like Git and Docker too

---
class: middle

Today's focus:

1. Make _workflows_ reproducible
1. Try {targets}

???
* We could talk about this all day, but I'm focusing on one particular thing today
* If these both mean nothing to you, then great
* If you know about workflow reproducibility, maybe you haven't considered {targets}
* If you do both these things, then you should be here talking instead of me

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 1. Make workflows reproducible

???
* I'm referring to analysis 'workflows', but you might say 'pipelines'
* As in you read, wrangle, model, plot and report data in some fashion
* The process of turning inputs to outputs
* This talk assumes that you do this in R, but ideas are transferable



---
class: middle

What about your analytical _workflow_ itself?

How do you keep track of function, file and object relationships?

???
* Have you considered this before?
* You might be asking why you might even do this -- is it really a big deal?

---
class: middle

What if:

* you haven't recorded the steps?
* the interdependencies become complex?
* some steps are computationally intensive?
* something changes?

???
* You might be thinking 'no, what's the point?'
* What impact does a change to file 'A' have?
* What if it's time intensive?
* Do you re-run everything from scratch if there's a change?
* Maybe this isn't a big deal for a small analysis, but things can get out of hand quickly

---
class: middle, center

You can't remember this

<img src='img/frederik-aust.png' width='60%'>

???
* Here's a real analysis
* All of the files, functions and objects that result in one final output on the right
* The spaghetti is all the relationships
* How could you possibly remember the exact things to re-run if something changes?

Let a workflow manager handle it

<img src='img/awesome.png' width=95%>

`r icon::fa('github')` [pditommaso/awesome-pipeline](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline)

???
* There are many workflow managers -- some general, some language-specific
* The one that most people might be familiar with is Make (capital 'M')
* It's language agnostic, but has some limitations -- it operates on files, for example and requires you to learn how to use Make
* Luigi and Airflow are alternatives for Python
* This is a powerful thought technology

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 2. Try {targets}

???
* If there's so many managers then why {targets}?

[{targets}](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/) by [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/)

???
* {targets}: the R package built by Will Landau for managing workflows and making your analysis pipeline more reproducible

---
class: middle

From [the manual](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/):

>...<mark>learns</mark> how your pipeline fits together, <mark>skips costly runtime</mark> for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the <mark>necessary computation</mark>, supports implicit <mark>parallel computing</mark>, abstracts files as <mark>R objects</mark>, shows <mark>tangible evidence</mark> that the results match the underlying code and data.

---
class: middle

Plus excellent docs:

* the [site](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/) and [source](https://github.com/ropensci/targets)
* the [{targets} R package user manual](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/index.html)
* [minimal example](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-minimal) (can be run in RStudio Cloud)
* [targetsketch](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/targetsketch/): a Shiny app for learning {targets} and setup new projects

Supersedes [{drake}](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/) by [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/)

<img src="img/drake-hex.png" width="25%"/>

>...major <mark>user-side limitations</mark> regarding data management, collaboration, and parallel efficiency

???
* This sounds suspiciously similar to {drake}.
* "Community feedback have exposed major user-side limitations regarding data management, collaboration, and parallel efficiency."
* "Solutions in drake itself would make the package incompatible with existing projects that use it, and the internal architecture is too copious, elaborate, and mature for such extreme refactoring."
* "The targets package borrows from past learnings, user suggestions, discussions, complaints, success stories, and feature requests, and it improves the user experience in ways that will never be possible in drake."

---

At its simplest:

1. Write a pipeline script
1. Execute the script
1. Change stuff
1. Go to 2

???
* The smallest amount of things you need to do is run two functions
* You create a 'plan' object that' contains the functions, objects and data in your's a bit like a recipe for generating your analysis
* Then you run `make()` on that object to run the steps and 'bake your cake'
* Let's go through a simple, arbitrary, trivial example
* We're not going to think too hard about folder structure in this example
* In fact, this workflow will be running from within this {xaringan} (RMarkdown slides)

---

<img src='img/beaver.png' width=50%>

# Contrived, simple demo

???
* Using the built-in `beaver1` and `beaver2` datasets
* You can see something similar in the walkthrough chapter of the {targets} user manual
* This example is run entirely within this {xaringan} presentation, giving you a flavour of its versatility

---
class: middle

The goal: a {targets} pipeline that creates a chart and table for an R Markdown file and renders it.

Then change something and re-run the pipeline.

---
class: middle

Generate `_targets.R` in working directory

```{r eval=FALSE}
tar_script()
```

You can [view the file](https://github.com/matt-dray/targets-dsfest/blob/master/_targets.R)  for this example online

---
class: middle

Set up functions and options in `_targets.R`

```{r eval=FALSE}
tar_option_set(
  packages = c(
    "targets", "tarchetypes", "knitr",
    "dplyr", "ggplot2", "rphylopic",
  )
)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
b_plot <- function(data, image) {
  ggplot(data, aes(id, temp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Weasel temperatures") +
    add_phylopic(image)
}
```


???
* Add your bespoke functions in the `_targets.R` file
* Here's one (`b_plot`) for making a plot, there's another for making a summary table
* In the option syou can provide the packages to be used

---
class: middle

Set up pipeline in `_targets.R`

```{r eval=FALSE}
targets <- list(
  tar_target(b1, mutate(beaver1, id = "A")),
  tar_target(b2, mutate(beaver2, id = "B")),
  tar_target(beavers, bind_rows(b1, b2)),
  tar_target(uid, "be8670c2-a5bd-4b44-88e8-92f8b0c7f4c6"),
  tar_target(png, image_data(uid, size = "512")[[1]]),
  tar_target(plot, b_plot(beavers, png)),  #<<
  tar_target(table, b_table(beavers)),
  tarchetypes::tar_render(report, "beavers-report.Rmd")  #<<
)

tar_pipeline(targets)  #<<
```

???
* Then it's a case of making a `tar_pipeline()`, which {targets} uses to 'remember' the relationships between objects
* Mark objects as targets with `tar_target()`
* `tarchetypes::tar_render()` is a special `tar_target()` case to account for redndering Rmd

To recap:

1. `tar_script()` creates `_targets.R`
1. Add `tar_targets()`
1. Check `tar_manifest()`
1. `tar_visnetwork()` to visualise
1. Execute with `tar_make()`
1. Change stuff, check `tar_outdated()`
1. Go to 4
