# Results

What does the distribution of body temperatures look like?

```{r r-plot, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(plot)
```

And what are the mean body temperature values?

```{r r-table, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(table) %>% kable()
```

# About

From the `?beavers` help page:

> Reynolds (1994) describes a small part of a study of the long-term temperature dynamics of beaver Castor canadensis in north-central Wisconsin. Body temperature was measured by telemetry every 10 minutes for four females, but data from a one period of less than a day for each of two animals is used there.
